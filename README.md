### Bayesian inference of Gaussian mixture models

This project provides R and MATLAB functions for performing Gaussian mixture model fitting using a Bayesian approach. Gaussian mixture models are able to fit data with complicated density functions, using only a few parameters. Different peaks or bumps in the density are fit with different Gaussians
